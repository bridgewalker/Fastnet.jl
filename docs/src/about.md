## About the name
This package is called Fastnet because it can simulate networks fast. However the name also reminds of Fastnet rock. A small rocky island off the Irish coast that boasts a distinctive lighthouse. Before the lighthouse was built, many sailors died in wrecks on this lonely rock. This image serves as a reminder of our solidarity that blooms in harsh environments and our ability to make the world a better, safer place by making contributions toward a common good. One way to make such a contribution today is to advance humanity's knowledge and capabilites through freely accessible research and free software. If you use Fastnet, consider making also the results of your work freely available. Please build a lighthouse on the foundations I laid by providing this package.
